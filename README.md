- 👋 Hi, I’m @liquidlovemonster.

- 👀 I’m interested in leaning new frameworks in web development. I used to develop years ago using php/lamp etc. also using the ASP, MS-SQL/ISS setup, 
this was done via a in house dev machine and then using ftp to commit to a live server. I've never used github so this method is new to me. 

- I learned some basic javaScript a few years back and also used JQuery. I'm very rusty and looking for a way to transfer and update my skills after being out the loop
for over 10 years. What's the easiest way to take my existing skills and update them or what's a simple framework to start with for webdev?. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to start by buiding a portfolio and personal information page. 

- I'm currently using MXLinux Wildflower, and have downloaded vs code which is also new to me, I used to use Dreamweaver.
